MAR-ATL-FOOTHILLS,,"Marrakech","Atlas Foothills","Kasbah Bab Ourika","Day Trip","Atlas","1.5","6","Sightseeing|Shopping|Lunch","Easy","Breakfast|Lunch","Day trip from Marrakech into the Atlas foothills. Kasbah Bab Ourika with valley views.","The road climbs gently into green. Kasbah Bab Ourika appears above terraced valleys—lunch here overlooks mountains and mist. Stop at a women's cooperative where argan oil is pressed by hand and saffron threads are sorted. Return through villages that smell of rose water. Marrakech waits below."
MAR-AGAFAY,,"Marrakech","Agafay Desert","","Transfer","Atlas","1","8","Relaxation|Desert|Glamping","Easy","Lunch|Dinner","Drive to the Agafay desert for an overnight glamping experience.","Forty-five minutes from Marrakech and the world changes. Rocky moonscape instead of medina. The camp appears white against brown—your tent has a proper bed and the silence is absolute. Lunch. Swim. Read. Walk. Watch the light shift until sunset turns everything gold. Dinner by firelight. Stars you forgot existed."
AGAFAY-MAR,,"Agafay Desert","Marrakech","","Transfer","Atlas","1","4","Sunrise|Breakfast","Easy","Breakfast","Return from Agafay desert to Marrakech.","Sunrise in the desert is worth the early alarm. Light spreads across the rocks like spilled honey. Breakfast at your own pace. The drive back feels shorter than it should—the city reappears and with it the noise and scent and color. But something stays. A stillness you didn't know you needed."
