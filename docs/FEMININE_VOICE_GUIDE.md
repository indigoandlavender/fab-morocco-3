# Fab Morocco: Feminine Voice Guide
*Inspired by Souk & Co's sensory, design-forward approach*

---

## The Shift

**FROM** (current):
> "Cross the High Atlas and follow Morocco's longest river to the edge of the Sahara."

**TO** (feminine):
> "The scent of orange blossom fades as you climb. By afternoon, palm groves appear in ribbons of green against pink earth. Zagora waits where the road gives way to sand."

---

## Core Principles

### 1. SENSORY FIRST
Lead with what you'll **feel**, not what you'll **see**.

- Scents: Orange blossom, cedar, saffron, leather, mint, rose water
- Textures: Cool zellige tiles, warm sand between toes, rough wool carpets
- Light: Dappled through carved plaster, golden on pink walls, soft through palm fronds
- Sounds: Call to prayer, fountain in courtyard, silence of the desert

### 2. DESIGN APPRECIATION
Women often travel for beauty, not bucket lists.

- Mention: Tiled courtyards, carved cedarwood, painted ceilings, brass lanterns
- Notice: Color (dusty pink, soft terracotta, deep indigo), pattern (zellige, boucherouite)
- Appreciate: The riad hidden behind an unmarked door, the perfect breakfast table

### 3. INTIMATE SCALE
Not crowds. Not tourism. Discovery.

- "A courtyard filled with..."
- "A rooftop where..."
- "A table set for..."
- "Hidden behind..."

### 4. PERMISSION TO INDULGE
Shopping is not guilty—it's cultural immersion.

- Rugs, ceramics, leather, textiles
- Artisan workshops, not tourist souks
- "You'll want to leave room in your suitcase"

### 5. FOOD AS EXPERIENCE
Not fuel. Ritual.

- "Mint tea poured from height"
- "Tagine served in the pot it was cooked in"
- "Breakfast on a rooftop terrace"
- "Dinner by candlelight in a tiled courtyard"

## Tour Description Examples

### BEFORE (factual):
> **3-Day Sahara Desert**
> The classic Merzouga experience. Cross the Atlas. Sleep in the dunes. Return through the valleys.

### AFTER (feminine):
> **3-Day Sahara Desert**
> The one you've been dreaming about. Rose-gold dunes at sunset. Dinner by firelight. Waking to silence so complete you'll hear your own heartbeat. This is the Morocco that stays with you.

---

### BEFORE:
> **Day 1: Marrakech to Dades Valley**
> Cross the Atlas via Tizi n'Tichka pass. Stop at Ait Benhaddou. Continue to Dades.

### AFTER:
> **Day 1: Marrakech to Dades Valley**
> Leave the pink city behind as the road climbs into cedar and stone. The pass opens onto a different world—ochre kasbahs, green valleys, light that changes by the hour. Your riad tonight sits above a river you'll hear from your room.

## Image Direction

**Current style**: Landscape-forward, wide shots, dramatic
**Add**: 

- Close-ups of details (zellige tiles, brass door knockers, tea being poured)
- Soft morning light through carved screens
- Tables set for breakfast on terraces
- Hands touching textiles
- Doorways and courtyards (the reveal)
- Food beautifully plated
- Women in the frame (not posed, natural moments)

**Color palette shift**:
- Less: Saturated orange dunes, harsh midday
- More: Dusty pink, soft terracotta, indigo shadows, golden hour

## The Souk & Co Secret

They sell **transformation**, not transportation.

> "You will leave a different person"
> "Life changing"  
> "Trip of a lifetime"
> "I still talk about it years later"

Fab Morocco can promise the same—just at a different price point.

**The hook**: Same magic. Your own pace. Your own adventure.
